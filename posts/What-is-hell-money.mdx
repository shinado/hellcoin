## Definition and Cultural Significance

Hell money, also known as joss paper, is a form of paper currency designed to resemble real banknotes. However, it is not recognized as legal tender in any country. Instead, it holds a special place in the cultural and religious traditions of many East Asian countries, especially China.

## Historical Origins

The history of hell money can be traced back to ancient times. It is believed that the practice of burning paper money for the deceased originated from the ancient Chinese belief in the afterlife. People thought that the dead would need money to live comfortably in the underworld, just as they did in the real world. This custom has been passed down through generations and has become an important part of many traditional festivals and ceremonies, such as the Qingming Festival and the Ghost Festival.

## Design Features

The design of hell money varies. In the past, the denominations were relatively small, but as time went by and influenced by inflation in the real world, the denominations of modern hell money have become extremely large, often ranging from tens of thousands to billions. The obverse side of the note usually features an image of the Jade Emperor, who is a significant figure in Taoism. There is also a signature that can be romanized as "yu wong" or "yuk wong", along with the countersignature of Yanluo, the King of Hell. On the reverse side, there is typically an image of the "Bank of Hell". Additionally, some hell money may depict other famous figures from Chinese mythology, and in some cases, even deceased celebrities like John F. Kennedy, Albert Einstein, and Marilyn Monroe.

## Handling and Burning Customs

When it comes to the customs related to hell money, people usually handle it with respect. When burning the notes, they are either placed in a loose bundle or, in some regions, each note is carefully folded in a specific way before being tossed into the fire. This is because in traditional beliefs, burning real money is considered to bring bad luck.

## Modern - Day Significance and Controversies

In modern society, although hell money has no real - world economic value, it still plays an important role in cultural and emotional aspects. It serves as a way for people to express their love and remembrance for their ancestors and deceased relatives, and it is also a carrier of traditional culture, reflecting the unique values and beliefs of the East Asian region. However, with the development of the times, some people also question the rationality of this custom, especially in terms of environmental protection. In response, some places have begun to advocate more environmentally friendly ways of commemorating the dead while still respecting traditional cultures.
